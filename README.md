During a research task, I came across the report "Overview of Renewable Energy Power Generation and Conversion (2015-2023)" on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372441898_Overview_of_Renewable_Energy_Power_Generation_and_Conversion_2015-2023">ResearchGate</a>. This RAG model utilizes the report as a knowledge base to enhance domain-specific question answering.
